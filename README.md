# Arduino-SOD
SOD neural network library implimentation on arduino for object detection.

perfect lightweight library for porting to arduino.  found the files needed for compile, its just a matter of getting it to compile now.

was going to try sobel kernel face detection for faster results but this seems to be plenty fast.

https://github.com/symisc/sod based on this library
